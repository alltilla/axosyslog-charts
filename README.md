# AxoSyslog Helm Charts - a cloud-native distribution of syslog-ng by Axoflow

This repository contains various [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) for syslog-ng. You can use these charts to install the [AxoSyslog - cloud-ready syslog-ng images](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog-docker) created and maintained by [Axoflow](https://axoflow.com).

## How to use

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add axosyslog https://axoflow.github.io/axosyslog-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
axosyslog` to see the charts.

To install the axosyslog-collector chart:

    helm install my-axosyslog-collector axosyslog/axosyslog-collector

To uninstall the chart:
